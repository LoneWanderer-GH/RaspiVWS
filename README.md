# RaspiVWS: Raspberry Pi VLC Webcam Streaming, with Logitech C920 USB webcam

## Goal
This project aims at providing a simple and convenient way to perform webcam streaming over HTTP using a Raspberry Pi and Logitech C920.
It can be used as a babycam, dashcam, surveillance cam, and any other idea you might have.
There are ideas for major future improvements, it will depend on how much time I can give to it.
**This is tested and working in conditions indicated below.**

## How is it different from other projects ?

* It requires little to no additional installation over an existing Raspbian image. It relies on preinstalled software. If it is not installed, it will show an error explaining what is missing.
* Low CPU footprint: there is little to no transcoding performed by the pi, due to usage of the webcam capabilities (native H264 video stream)
* Script is straightforward: launch it, and voil√†.
* Can be easily integrated to jobs, cron, <you name it> and automation.

## 1. Why
This project comes from my answer to [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49846400/raspberry-pi-use-vlc-to-stream-webcam-logitech-c920-h264-video-without-tran/)
I decided to push it to another level.
To do:
- [ ] Go to another higher level with a more evolved concept

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
## 2. Prerequisites
You must have :
 1. basic Linux/Unix/Raspbian, Git or Github knowledge to peform the commands below
 2. a Raspberry Pi 3B+ (other Raspberries may not be supported). See what it is [on the official website<img src="/assets/Raspi-PGB001[1].png" width='5%' height='5%'/>](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
 3. A Logitech C920 webcam connected to your Raspberry Pi (USB). It *could* work with other webcam with additional modifications. Please give credit to my work if you do any improvements.


You should have `VLC` and `v4l-utils` packages already installed on you Pi. If not, see below:
 ```
 sudo apt-get install vlc v4l-utils
 ```
See [VLC website ![Get VLC icon](https://images.videolan.org/images/goodies/getvlc.png)](https://www.videolan.org/vlc)

<a name="Usage"></a>
## 3. Usage

Install it, assuming you are in your user profile home directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/LoneWanderer-GH/RaspiVWS
```

Go into the created folder:

```
cd RaspiVWS
```

Ensure you have execution rigths on the script

```
chmod +x Raspi_VLC_Webcam_Stream.sh
```

Execute command, eg:

```
./Raspi_VLC_Webcam_Stream.sh -h
```

It should produce a console output similar to this:

```
Usage: ./Raspi_VLC_Webcam_Stream.sh [-h|--help] [-o|--output-videos-directory <arg>] [-m|--video-file-name-mask <arg>] [--video-files-split-after <arg>] [--stop-stream-after <arg>] [--(no-)use-ssmtp] [--(no-)force-led-on] [--video-width <arg>] [--video-height <arg>] [-V|--verbose] [-v|--version] <video-device-number> [<http-port>]

	<video-device-number>: The video capture device number (webcam) that can be found in /dev. Ex: Put 0 if your device is /dev/video0
	<http-port>: The HTTP port to be used by VLC to provide the video stream from the video capture device. Default will be 8099 (default: '8099')
	-h,--help: Prints help
	-o,--output-videos-directory: Directory in which the VLC videos are stored. It means that the video stream will be recorded in addition to HTTP stream. Full path expected. (no default)
	-m,--video-file-name-mask: Videos files record name. Files will be generated as: 1970-12-31_%00h00m00s_<yourvalue>  (default: 'Webcam_Stream_Record')
	--video-files-split-after: Defines the unitary VLC record file duration in seconds. WARNING: Only necessary when output-videos-directory is used (default: '120')
	--stop-stream-after: Defines the delay after which the VLC record will stop in seconds. WARNING: Only necessary when output-videos-directory is used (default: '10800')
	--use-ssmtp,--no-use-ssmtp: Send mail using SSMTP command (if exists) indicating start of record (off by default)
	--force-led-on,--no-force-led-on: Forces the Logitech C920 LED to be on. (off by default)
	--video-width: Force video format width. Use at your own risk. (default: '1920')
	--video-height: Force video format height. Use at your own risk. (default: '1080')
	-V,--verbose: Console output verbosity. Controls both this command and underlying VLC verbosity.
	-v,--version: Prints version
  ```

## 4. Access to stream

On any other device connected to the same network as your pi, you can use VLC to access your RaspberryPi3+ VLC stream at this address:

```
vlc http://your-raspberrypi-ip:http-port
```

where:
* `http-port`: is the http-port defined when launching the command (default `8099`)
* `your-raspberrypi-ip`: your raspberry pi ip, you can find it using command `ifconfig`

<a name="AdditonalCommands"></a>
## 5. Additional commands, usage example

<a name="Wifi"></a>
### 5.1 Make RaspberryPi3+ a Wifi access point
 
If you have no existing network to connect your Pi to, you can follow [instructions from official RaspberryPi3+ website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md)
This will transform your pi into a wifi access point.

<a name="PlannedExecution"></a>
### 5.2 Planned execution tips

The following assumes your Pi unix user name is `pi` and that you installed RaspiWVS in your home folder, i.e. the script is located here:
```
/home/pi/RaspiVWS/Raspi_VLC_Webcam_Stream.sh
```

#### Method 1: rc.local

You can make the `rc.local` script use your custom script to be executed at startup.
You can follow [instructions from official RaspberryPi3+ website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/rc-local.md)

#### Method 2: Create a deamon service

We will create a "webcam-stream" service.
```
cd /lib/systemd/system/
sudo nano webcam-stream.service
```
And write in it:
```
[Unit]
Description=Custom Webcam Streaming Service
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/home/pi/RaspiVWS/Raspi_VLC_Webcam_Stream.sh
Restart=on-abort

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Make the service file and the script executable:
```
sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/webcam-stream.service
chmod +x /home/pi/RaspiVWS/Raspi_VLC_Webcam_Stream.sh
```

Allow VLC to be excuted as root:
```
sudo sed -i 's/geteuid/getppid/' /usr/bin/vlc
```

Reload deamons and enable our service:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable webcam-stream.service
```
Check it is recognized and working:
```
sudo service webcam-stream status
sudo service webcam-stream start
```
You can check with another computer that the video is correctly streamed.
Note that the webcam won't be available while the service is running.

### Method 3: Program execution at a given instant

To launch the execution today at 14:00, you can use the following command:
```
cd ~/RaspiVWS && ./Raspi_VLC_Webcam_Stream.sh | at 1400
```

See the `at` command manual for further details.

## 6. TROUBLESHOOTING

I recently ran into VLC error after a dist-upgrade:
```
VLC media player 2.2.6 Umbrella (revision 2.2.6-0-g1aae78981c)
[00acb230] pulse audio output error: PulseAudio server connection failure: Connection refused
```
The solution I found is to launch VLC in GUI mode and change the default audio device to ALSA (instead of Automatic). I can also be done in command line.
See the solution found here [VLC issues with PulseAudio](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=29403)

```
cvlc -A alsa,none --alsa-audio-device default
```
